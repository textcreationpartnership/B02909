            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>DEFENSIO Principis CURLANDIAE Suecorum Calumniis opposita.</head>
            <p>POst ruptas in Polonia inducias, pacem verò cum Danis vix citius initam quam fractam; post Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silvaniae Principem inter hostes, contra fidem da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam, destitutum; post temerata denique ubivis locorum Divina, humanaque Jura, nemini forté novum aut mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum videbitur, jussu Regis Sueciae, Principem Curlandiae, licet Medii sen Neutralis in hoc bello conditionem iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidem pactus erat, &amp; saepius magnâ argenti vi redeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, in Domo suâ per insidias captum, barbaricum in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum cum Uxore, septemque liberis, Rigam abductum esse.</p>
            <p>Caeterum quoniam ea in pacatum Principem admissa, quae nec in hoste locum haberent, in Matronam insigni pietate praeclarisque Virtutibus summum inter foeminas locum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentem, nisi nativitas dedisset, eamque partui vicinam; in liberos Principales, plerosque infantes, atque aetate, ut Parentes, vitâ innocentissimos, designata sunt: ipsis haec Suecis talia sunt visa, ut non sine excusatione aut defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sione Orbique patefieri deberent: Sed quae Dei benignitas atque Justitia est, vix alii innocentiam Optimorum Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipum illustriorem reddunt, quàm qui vel maximé op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant.</p>
            <p>Dicunt equidem quod libet qui causam hanc agunt, &amp; tamen apparet summo studio nihil fingi potuisse, quo tanta rei indignitas vel excusaretur. Fac vera esse quae com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti
<pb facs="tcp:179813:3"/>juut in hac causa omnia; fac fides habeatur praetex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, quae veritati debetur; nihil hic invenies, quod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentiae Principium praejudicare, aut Suecorum facto vel minimum Justitiae affricare posset colorem. Nimirum jungi potest justitiae maledicentia, nec tamen haec malos reddere potest, ant reos, quos illa miseros effecit.</p>
            <p>Quod ipsum patebit audienti hos Oratores, qui causam hanc dum defendunt, produnt. Caput accusationis est, Uxorem Principis suasisse Fratri suo Electori Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgico, ut cum Poloniae Rege, cujus olim vasallus ipse fuerat, maritus autem adhuc erat, in gratiam rediret. Adeò nec dicta nec consilia familiarium impunia sunt, &amp; illa quidem Uxoris, in caput Mariti expetunt, atque hic luat necesse est, quae illa admisit. Crodo, his arbitris, meritò pro hoste habendum, cujus Uxor alibi, ipso ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sente &amp; inscio, pacis consilia, inter cognatos, quibusque amorem atque reverentiam debebat, commendavit. Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licet quam à Deo continuis precibus ipsis efflagitare, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um fuerat, crimen suisset suadere. Sed nihil eam hic egisse, si Electori Sancté hoc asserenti non creditur, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere ipsis rerum argumentis necesse est. Involverat il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Rex Sueciae bello Polonico; gliscebat mox Danicum, &amp; successit. Autor Regi fuit Elector, ut, quod proclive ipsi erat, &amp; gloriosam sibi ut, &amp; utilem cum Polonis iniret pacem, Danicos vero motus aequis averteret conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus; sed frustrà fuit, ad eum gloriae campum quasi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missus eò ampliorem, quò pluribus insideretur hostibus. Ergo Rex in Holsatiam movet, &amp; foederatos, Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, Transilvanum{que} hostibas tantum non obrutos de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serit. Exuitur hic Exercitu, &amp; adhuc periculum est, ut Principatu fortunisque excidat omnibus. Expug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur Cracovia, occurrunt imminentque Electori Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitus Polonici, Auxiliaresque Austriaci atque Cosaci; à Suecis Suppetiae nullae. Hic Electorem nec mala, nec
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:179813:4"/>pericula, nec remedia praevidere potuisse putabimus? &amp; (quod unicum restabat) pacem eum Polonis non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecisse, nisi Soror submonuerit? Judicet qui velit, ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis Electori illam persuaserit, &amp; an non à Rege Sueciae Ipso proficiscatur, quod Optimae Principi tanquam crimen reputant?</p>
            <p>Sed intercessit Principi, inquiunt, familiaritas insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis cum Gonzievio, &amp; litteris hinc inde meantibus, quas partim Principis Ministros scripsisse perhibent, effectum, ut Anno <hi>1656.</hi> Lithuanis eorumque vicinis Copiae Sueciae, quae illic locorum erant, in manus quasi trade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur. Cum Gonsievio Principi agendum erat, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam cum vicino amico, Regis sui Ministro, &amp; egit; ita tamen, ut conditionis suae memor esset, &amp; observan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae erga Dominum, &amp; Neutralitatis, quam vocant, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges integrae semper sibi constarent. Nec unquam produci possunt literae Principis, aut Ipso indignae, aut rerum statui, quem diximus, parum convenientes: quid ege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint scripserintque Ministri, viderint ipsi, Principis hic nulla est culpa. Caeterùm cum Sueci Lithuanos &amp; Samogitas pessimè haberent, &amp; dispersi interim securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que inter eos agerent, an, quod immanissima facta ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torserunt, ad quod opportunitas invitavit, statui in Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos non potuit nisi Autore Curlandioe Duce? Nec hostes suos Lithuani cernere poterant focis assidentes, lateribus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que haerentes, nisi Curlandiae Duce ex longinquo demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strante?</p>
            <p>Imputatur praeterea, quod Magno Muscoviae Duci con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silia &amp; rationes capiendae Rigae unà cum commeatu sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditarit Princeps Curlandiae, idque egerit, ut Serenis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simi Angliae, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Protectoris studium pacis inter Muscos &amp; Suecos conficiendae à Moschis repudiaretur, quod sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stras de Suecis opintones Legato Anglico insinuaverit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nique quod Polonis Moschos conciliare, hos verò Suecis
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:179813:5"/>infensiores reddere annisus: atque in eo fuerit ut Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissimo Electori Brandenburgico trium millium suppetias mitteret.</p>
            <p>Utinam verò, ut ab ultimis ordiamur, tot habuisset Dux milites, atque abduci potuisset amicorum monitis, ut hac viâ securitati suae prospiceret; non tam opportunus Suecorum injuriis fuisset, &amp; haberet forsan optimus Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps Domum suam bonaque omnia intacta. Nunc fiducia pollicitationum regiarum unicé securo, milite destituto, cum militum copia adhuc objiciatur, vix acerbiùs candori ac innocentiae illudi posset atque insultari. Consilia autem ut suggereret Magno Muscoviae Duci nunquam Ipsi oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitas fuit, nec ut quicquam persuaderet authoritas. Commeatum si Moschi exegerunt, exegerunt &amp; Sueci &amp; Poloni. Damnum passus ab omnibus, injuriam nemini fecit. Infortunium illud miseratione dignum, culpae adnumerandum non fuerat.</p>
            <p>Pacem inter Moschos, Polones, Suecos, omnesque de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nique Vicinos optavit amantissimus pacis Princeps, &amp; cujus eam confieri intererat, si promovere non potuit, nullibi certè turbavit. Populos cum Populis committere non Illius sunt artes; qui tranquillitatem sibi suam non nisi Vicinorum omnium concordiâ constare intelligit: cujus omnes ex aequo observare, &amp; humanitate cum sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulis decertare, non armis. Hoc veró studium, hanc mentem Principi fuisse Ipse Anglicus testabitur Legatus, quem, quibus potuit humanitatis officiis, per aliquot menses Princeps prosequutus est, &amp; omitè habuit, non modò quòd peregrinus aut quia ab amico, sed comprimis quod pacis interpres venerat. Atqui ille ipse, inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, pessimis quibusque de Suecis opinionibus in Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landia imbutus est. Nimirum quae consclentia vera ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guit, ettam dicta creduntur. Sed si Suecis quibusdam mala mens, oportetnè propterea Carlandiae Principios im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purum

            <p>Moreover, Whereas such things were committed against a Peaceable Prince, which would not have place in an Enemy: Against a Princesse, (who for her unparallel'd Piety, and most illustrious Vertues, (to say nothing of her Birth) may justly claim the the highest place among Women) drawing near the time of her Delivery: Yea, against his Princely Children, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all Infants, and most innocent in their age, as their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in their lives. It seemes they have appeared to the <hi>Swedes</hi> themselves, to be of that nature, as that they ought not to be published to the world, without some kinde of excusation or defence: But such is the infinite Benignity and Justice of our God, that hardly any other could have demonstrated or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested more brighter, the spotlesse Innocence of these best of Princes, then the most unjust opposers of the same.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:179813:3"/>
            <p> Those who patrocinate this cause speak (indeed) their full, pleasure, and yet it appears, that with all their study and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, they have been uncapable to forge any thing, whereby so great an indignity might be rendred in the least excusable. Suppose all their manifest forgeries in this businesse to be true, and attribute that Faith (which is due to the truth) to their frivolous pretences, yet you will find nothing at all in them, that either can be any waies prejudicous to the Innocency of the Duke and Dutchesse, or yet give any the least colour of Justice to that inhnmane action of the <hi>Swedes.</hi> Besides, to the said notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous injustice, may be also added the slanderous aspersions, which yet will not be able to render those either bad or guilty, whom they have made miserable.</p>
            <p>And this will clearly appear, to him that hears these Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors speak, who striving to defend this cause, do betray the same. The head of the Accusation, is, That the <hi>Duke</hi>'s <hi>Lady,</hi> did perswade her Brother, the <hi>Prince Elector of Brandenborgh,</hi> to reconcile himself to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Poland</hi>'s Majesty, whose vassall he had eretimes been, and to whom he still stood engaged. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this rate, neither the words nor counsels of familiar friends are unpunishable; yea, even those of a Wife, would exact the head of her Husband, and he were to suffer for what she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited. I believe that (according to the Opinion of these Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators) that man may lawfully be termed an enemy, whose Wife in his absence, and unknown to him, hath otherwhere made good overtures for, and endeavoured the Recommendation of Peace betwixt her nearest Friends and Kinred, to whom she ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed love and reverence; and that it is a crime to counsell or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend Peace, when it is godly and most commendable, by incessant fervent Prayers to beg the same of God. But, that the said Princesse did nothing of this nature (if we will not believe the <hi>Prince Elector,</hi> religiously asserting the same) yet must we give credit to the Arguments of the matter it self. The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> having involved the said <hi>Elector</hi> in the <hi>Polonian</hi> War, and the <hi>Danish</hi> suddainly creeping in thereupon, and succeeding; his Electoral Highnesse advised the said King to make up (as he easily might) a Peace both glorious and profitable for himself, with the <hi>Poles,</hi> and to divert the <hi>Danish</hi> motions with equitable Conditions, but all in vain; the said <hi>Elector</hi> being (as it were)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:179813:4"/>sent back by the King with derision, to that height of glory held so much more ample and illustrious, by how much more enemies he was surrounded; and so the King moves towards <hi>Holstein,</hi> deserting his Confederates the Elector, and <hi>Trasilvanian</hi> Prince, even in a manner overwhelmed by the Enemy. Whereupon he of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> shortly after was deprived of his Army, and to this hour, runs hazard of the totall losse of his Country and Fortunes; the City of <hi>Cracovia</hi> was recovered; and the <hi>Prince Elector</hi> immediately <hi>(quasi)</hi> surrendred by the threatning for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Armies of the Confederate <hi>Poles, Austrians,</hi> and <hi>Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacks,</hi> being altogether left destitute of the least hopes of succour from the <hi>Swedes.</hi> And can we think that all this while, the said <hi>P. Elector</hi> could foresee neither Evils, nor Perils, nor Remedies? And that (which only was remaining) he could not have had thoughts of a Peace with the <hi>Poles,</hi> without the Admonition of his Sister? Judge whomsoever, who it was that perswaded the <hi>Elector</hi> thereunto, and whether it proceeds not from the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> himself, what is as a Crime imputed unto our most Vertuous Princesse.</p>
            <p>But (they say) the <hi>Duke</hi> kept great intimacy' with <hi>Gonzie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usky,</hi> and, that by interchangeable Letters (which partly they assert to have been written by the <hi>Duke</hi>'s Ministers) it hath been brought to passe, that in the Year 1656. the <hi>Swedish</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in those parts, were (in a manner) betrayed into the hands of the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> and their Neighbours. The <hi>Duke</hi> was forced to (and did indeed) Treat with <hi>Gonzieusky,</hi> as with a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Friend, and the Ministers of his King; yet so, as that he was altogether mindfull of his Condition, and how much it behooved him Sacredly and Inviolably to preserve no lesse the Laws of Neutrality, then the respect due to his <hi>Lord.</hi> Nor can ever any Letters of the <hi>Duke</hi> be produced, either unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of himself, or in the least contrarying the premifed State of affairs; what the Ministers have either done or written, they themselves must answer, the <hi>Prince</hi> for his part, is herein most innocent. Moreover, when the <hi>Swedes</hi> most basely trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> and <hi>Samogitians,</hi> and yet in the mean time, were securely and confusedly dispersed among them, could not that, which their most horrid actions did extorte from, and whereunto the fairest opportunity invited the said <hi>Lithuanians,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:179813:5"/>be executed upon the <hi>Swedes,</hi> but by Instinction of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Curland?</hi> And could not they see their Enemies, when sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at their fire sides, and hanging upon their very backs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Curland</hi> had afar off pointed at them?</p>
            <p>It is further imputed, that the <hi>Duke</hi> did give Counsell and Directions to the great <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> for the taking of <hi>Riga,</hi> together with Supplies for his Army; as also, that he did effect (or cause) that his most Serene Highnesse the <hi>Lord Protector</hi>'s <hi>of England,</hi> &amp;c. endeavoures for Peace betwixt the <hi>Muscovites</hi> and <hi>Swedes,</hi> were rejected by the said <hi>Muscovites:</hi> That he did insinuate sinister Opinions of the <hi>Swedes</hi> to the Ambassadour of <hi>England:</hi> And lastly, that he did endeavour to reconcile the <hi>Poles</hi> and <hi>Muscovites,</hi> but to render these more incensed against the <hi>Swedes;</hi> yea, that he was upon it, to have sent a succour of 3000 men of his own, to the most Serene <hi>Prince Elector</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were to be wished (to begin with the last) that the <hi>Duke</hi> had had such a number of Forces, and could have been induc'd and disposed by all the seasonable Admonitions of his Friends, to have provided for his own security that way; he would not then have been so lyable and obnoxious to the <hi>Swedish</hi> injuries, but perhaps (Good Prince) have preserved his House and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state intire and safe to this hour: whereas now Integrity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency could hardly be more cruelly eluded and insulted over, then to object a numerous Power of Forces to him, who, securely relying upon, and only confiding in the Royal Promises was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether destitute of Souldiers. As for his (pretended) sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested Counsels to the great <hi>Duke,</hi> he neither ever had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity thereunto, nor yet authority to perswade any thing. If the <hi>Muscovites</hi> exacted passage and free quarters, the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Poles</hi> exacted no lesse; he suffered Dammage by all, but did Injury to none. This misfortune had been more worthy of pitty then of punishment.</p>
            <p>A Peace betwixt the <hi>Muscovites, Poles, Swedes,</hi> and all other his Neighbours, the Prince (as a most perfect Peace Lover) did cordially wish, and being so much concerned in the confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the same, if he could not promote; yet leastwise, he was farre from (any where) perturbing or obstructing it. To stir up Nation against Nation, are not his Practises, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands

               <pb facs="tcp:179813:7"/>his own Tranquility and Preservation to depend only from his Neighbours generall Concordance and Unanimity, and whom it behooves to give equall respect to all, and rather to winne the heart of every one with Civility, then by force of Armes. Now, that this hath been the reall mind and endeavours of the <hi>Duke,</hi> the English Ambassadour himself, cannot but wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, whom the <hi>Duke</hi> did prosecute with all possible demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of Civility, and entertained most lovingly for many Moneths together, not only for being a stranger, or the Minister of a potent Friend, but chiefly for coming as a Peace-Maker. But he, himself (they say) was possest with most sinistrous Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Swedes</hi> in <hi>Curland;</hi> as if, what Conscience doth but argue to be true, must be granted to be spoken also. But if any of the <hi>Swedes</hi> have an ill heart, must it therefore follow that the mouth of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Curland</hi> is impure and slanderous? But let us return from whence we have made a Digression.</p>
            <p>Suppose all these things to be so, notwithstanding that the Serene <hi>Dutchesse</hi> in her Letters to the <hi>Prince Elector</hi> her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (taking God to witnesse, and having pleaded and discussed the Cause, in the Tribunal of her own Conscience) doth sacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm, That she cannot find any other fault in her self or hers, but, that having committed no ill, and therefore not fearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they had too much confided in those that make profession of Christianity and Evangelical Religion.</p>
            <p>But let us (I say) grant this to the enemy, that those Princes (the most Religious Observers of their Compacts, and whom their very Piety, Godlinesse, and Condition alone doth easily ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve) have committed all these objected Crimes, and yet more grievous ones, if they please; yet after that the old agreement of Neutrality was again renewed and confirmed, with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Army (not without a cementation of friendship, which they that mean to transact with such kind of people, must ever have ready at hand; I mean ready money, but newly, with much ado, raised by the <hi>Duke:</hi>) and (as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest) but very few hours interceding betwixt the making of the said Covenant, and immediate ensuing irruption into the Castle of the said <hi>Duke;</hi> in as much as the <hi>Swedes</hi> must either have taken away, or else anticipated themselves, all the Crimes that can possibly be forged against his Highnesse; No man
<pb facs="tcp:179813:8"/>(surely) can believe, that after all this, the said <hi>Duke</hi> can just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be accused of any thing. There must then be of her Reasons which moved and impulsed the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> to accelerate and hasten this deplorable misfortune unto the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Curland.</hi> And indeed, there are, that think that he did it, to vex and spight the <hi>P. Elector</hi> of <hi>Brandenborgh,</hi> in that, when he was not able to invade him (who was now too powerfull in Armes, and more wary of being circumvented then heretofore) he did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power the unarmed and uncapable of Resistance. The <hi>P. Elector</hi> indeed, deplores the hard fate of his Friends, and all honest hearts condole with them: But their unspotted innocence doth powerfully mitigate and allay his sorrow, as also the infinite Justice of God, which is wont generally to Crown the same with a most prpsperous issue even of the affliction it self; and contrarily to behold the Enemies thereof with such an eye, as doth every where witnesse him no lesse a most Severe Judge and Avenger, then a tender and gracious Father: He knows that those that commit such enormous Actions, do but so much the more speedily provoke, ripen, and <hi>augment</hi> the <hi>just vengeance of the Lord,</hi> by how much brighter the Innocence of the oppressed party appeares. Others think, that the commodious situation of <hi>Curland,</hi> upon the <hi>Baltique,</hi> made the teeth of him, that affects the Dominion thereof, to water. But as the acquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard yeelded but small increase to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> so also all good people, expect to see what will be the end and issue of the affectation of more then one Kingdom, and violent ereption of more then one Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Principality. And indeed, we have already beheld an eminent sign of the (not retarding) Justice of God, in that, the very next day after the barbarous carrying away of the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Curland</hi> into Captivity, being the 28<seg rend="sup">th</seg> of <hi>October,</hi> a few Ships of the United Neatherland States (the most of the Fleet not having been engaged in the fight) did, by the burning of some, taking others, and sinking not a few <hi>Swedish</hi> Ships, most happily effectuate the raising of the Seige of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> and cause the world to smile in beholding those, that did boast the Dominion of the Sea, uncapable (notwithstanding the two imminent Castles upon either side of the Shoare) to defend or maintain the most inconsiderable part of the same,
